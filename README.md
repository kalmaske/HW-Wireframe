Testing my ability in  HTML/CSS. 

Basics matters in the process of learning web development is nothing without a serious time investment.

What I did was

1)created and cloned this repository 

2)create two files inside this folder: index.html and style.css.

3)made my initial Git commit and push it to GitHub

  step1. git add .

  step2. git commit -m "<COMMENT>"

  step3. git push origin master
  
The two files appeared in the repository. This was an initial test to confirm that I am hooked into GitHub.

4)returned to my local copies of index.html and style.css. Using the HowItShouldBe.png as a challenge to test my abilities and started designing using HTML/CSS.
